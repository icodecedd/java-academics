# Java Academic Practice Repository

This repository contains a collection of academic exercises and lessons in Java, created to strengthen understanding of core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and problem-solving skills taught in class.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Each folder is organized to reflect different areas of Java learning and coursework:

- **Exercises** â€“ Topic-specific coding problems that reinforce fundamental Java skills such as loops, conditionals, data types, and OOP basics.
- **Hands-On Activities** â€“ Guided academic tasks and mini-projects from coursework that apply Java concepts to practical scenarios.
- **Java Lessons 1 to 5** â€“ Examples, notes, and code snippets covering foundational topics taught in early Java lessons, including:
  - Basic syntax and structure
  - Classes and objects
  - Inheritance and polymorphism
  - Control flow
  - Input/output operations  

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A learning record of Java programming lessons taught in class  
- A practice space for applying theoretical knowledge to code  
- A reference hub for reviewing concepts and improving coding proficiency
